### Manuevering a cave

Statement - The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a m X n matrix with the 
constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.

Examples : 

Input :  m = 2, n = 2;
Output : 2
There are two paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)

Input :  m = 2, n = 3;
Output : 3
There are three paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
